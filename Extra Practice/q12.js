// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names_q12 = ["Zunash", "Mamoona", "Zahra"];
console.log("Hello ".concat(names_q12[0], "! How are you doing?"));
console.log("Hello ".concat(names_q12[1], "! How are you doing?"));
console.log("Hello ".concat(names_q12[2], "! How are you doing?"));
