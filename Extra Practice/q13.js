// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const examples1 = ["Alto", "Civic", "Mehran", "Wagon-R"];
examples1.forEach((example) => {
