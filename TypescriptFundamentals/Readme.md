Develop functions for specific tasks.
Manipulate arrays using various methods.
Solve problems using Typescript code.
Instructions
Answer each question by writing the appropriate Typescript code.
Test your code to ensure it meets the specifications given in each question.
Comment your code where necessary to explain your logic.
Questions
Easy
Write a script to log "Hello, World!" to the console.
Create a variable temperature and assign it a value. Then log "It's cold!" if the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius.
Use arithmetic operators to solve the problem: If you have 10 apples and you give away 3, how many do you have left? Log the result.
Declare two variables, firstName and lastName, then create a third variable fullName that combines them. Log the result.
Write a TypeScript code that uses a comparison operator to check if the number 5 is greater than 3. Log "Yes" if true, otherwise log "No".
Medium
Create a function calculateArea that takes the radius of a circle as an input and returns the area of the circle.
Write a loop that logs numbers from 1 to 50. For multiples of 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, log "Buzz".
Define an array temperatures with at least five different temperatures (numbers). Write a script to find and log the highest temperature.
Create a script that prompts the user to enter their age and then logs whether they are a minor (under 18) or an adult.
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the count of positive numbers in the array.
Arrays and Array Methods
Write a function that takes an array of words and returns a new array containing only the words that start with the letter 'a'.
Create a script that logs the second to last element of an array named fruits.
Develop a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number squared.
Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array and reverses its elements without using the .reverse() method. Log the result.
Given an array scores [10, 5, 20, 20, 4, 5, 2, 25, 1], write a function that logs the number of times the score exceeded the maximum score and the number of times it fell below the minimum score.
Create a function that removes all falsey values from an array. Falsey values include false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.
Write a script that concatenates two arrays [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] into a single array.
Develop a function called sumOfElements that calculates the sum of all elements in an array that are either even or odd, based on a parameter.
Create a function that checks whether an element exists in an array. If it exists, return the index, otherwise return -1.
Write a function to find and return the smallest number in an array of integers.
Functions
Write a function calculateProduct that takes an array of numbers and returns the product of all elements.
Develop a function filterByLength that takes an array of strings and a number n. The function should return an array containing only the strings that are longer than n characters.
Create a function findDuplicates that finds and logs all duplicates in an array.
Write a function incrementAll that takes an array of integers and increments each element by one.
Develop a function countOccurrences that counts how many times a specific element appears in an array.
Create a function isSorted that checks if an array is sorted in ascending order.
Write a function that receives an array of names and formats them into a string separated by commas, except for the last two names, which should be separated by "and".
Develop a function that converts an array of Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius and logs the new temperatures.
Write a function minMaxAverage that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with properties for the minimum, maximum, and average of those numbers.
Create a function swapElements that swaps two specified indices in an array.
Hard
Develop a function that takes two inputs, a string and a character, and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.
Create a 'to-do list' array of objects where each object has properties task and completed (a boolean). Write a function to log only the tasks that are not yet completed.
Write a function that takes an array of integers and sorts them from smallest to largest.
Develop a TypeScript program that logs every element of an array in reverse order without using the .reverse() method.
Write a script that simulates a basic calculator. It should take two operands and an operator ('+', '-', '*', '/') from the user, perform the operation, and log the result.
